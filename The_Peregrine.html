    <p> "From fall to spring, J.A. Baker set out to track the daily comings and goings of a pair of peregrine falcons across the flat
  fen lands of eastern England. He followed the birds obsessively, observing them in the air and on the ground, in pursuit of their
  prey, making a kill, eating, and at rest, activities he describes with an extraordinary fusion of precision and poetry. And as he
  continued his mysterious private quest, his sense of human self slowly dissolved, to be replaced with the alien and implacable consciousness
  of a hawk.It is this extraordinary metamorphosis, magical and terrifying, that these beautifully written pages record." (Taken from <a href="https://www.nyrb.com/products/the-peregrine?variant=1094932429">New York Review Books</a>)</p>
